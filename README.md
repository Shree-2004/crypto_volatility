## ðŸ“ˆ Project Pipeline
1. **Data Ingestion** â€“ Load historical Bitcoin OHLCV data from CSV.
2. **Preprocessing** â€“ Clean missing values, handle invalid data, filter for Bitcoin.
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Create `volatility`, `liquidity_ratio`, and `rolling_volatility`.
4. **EDA** â€“ Generate correlation heatmaps, volatility trends, and distributions.
5. **Model Training** â€“ Train Random Forest Regressor.
6. **Evaluation** â€“ Measure RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
7. **Deployment** â€“ Serve predictions via Streamlit web app.
